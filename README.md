## VisionLink - Video Conferencing Application (MERN Stack)

**Overview:**

This project is a full-stack video conferencing application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It aims to provide a user-friendly platform for real-time video and audio communication, similar to the popular video conferencing tool Zoom.

## Key Features

- **Real-time video and audio communication:** Users can connect and interact with others through audio and video streams.
- **Room creation and management:** Users can create and manage private or public rooms for video conferences.
- **Screen sharing:** Users can share their screens with others in the room for presentations or collaboration.
- **Chat functionality:** Users can engage in text-based messaging within a video call.
- **User authentication and authorization:** Users can register and log in to the application, and access control mechanisms are in place to manage room permissions.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux (optional for state management)
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB (or a database of your choice)
- **Real-time communication:** WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) or a third-party solution like Socket.IO

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:** Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) package manager installed on your system.
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zoom-clone.git
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd zoom-clone
   npm install
   ```
4. **Configure database:** Update database connection details in the backend configuration file (e.g., `.env` or similar).
5. **Start the application:**
   - **Backend:**
     ```bash
     npm start:backend
     ```
   - **Frontend:**
     ```bash
     npm start:frontend
     ```

## Additional Notes

- This README.md provides a high-level overview. Refer to the codebase and relevant documentation for specific implementation details.
- Real-time communication using WebRTC is complex and may require additional configuration and testing. Consider using a third-party library or service if needed.
- Security considerations are crucial for video conferencing applications. Implement proper authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms to protect user data and communication.
- This is a basic foundation for a video conferencing application. You can extend its functionality with features like recording, meeting scheduling, integration with third-party tools, and more.
